== Context

There are dozen of assertion library available, we want to settle one for
our purpose and rely just on this one.

== Decision

After some consideration we aggreed on using https://assertj.github.io/doc/[AssertJ].

== Consequences

[[adr:AssertionLibrary]]
[source,cypher,role=constraint,severity=minor]
.All calls to `assertThat` must be from `AssertJ`!
